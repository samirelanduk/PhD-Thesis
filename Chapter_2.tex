\lhead{Chapter 2. \emph{Computational Techniques}} % Write in your own chapter title to set the page header
In this chapter, the pre-existing algorithms and other computational techniques used to predict Zinc Binding Sites will be outlined.

It will not provide details of specific implementations of them used in this project, or any novel tecnhniques developed - those will be presented in later chapters. It is instead meant to give a general mathematical background to these techniques, and familiarise the reader with the terms that will be used in later chapters.
