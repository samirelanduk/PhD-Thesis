Proteins are polymer chains of amino acid residues, and while the chemical diversity of the twenty canonical amino acids utilised in Biology can offer proteins a staggering variety of folds and functionality, there remain chemical processes that are not possible using only this chemical species. Consequently, many proteins use cofactors. These are chemicals which associate with the protein but are not generally covalently bound to them.

In order for a protein to induce this association to happen, it must present a region of its surface that the cofactor in question will experience an attraction to \note{And association must be thermodyamically favourable}. The residues that make up this attractive region are called binding sites.

Metal atoms are a common cofactor \note{Why?}. In this case the binding site is a metal binding site, and when the metal is zinc we can speak of a `zinc binding site'.

Clearly, zinc will only experience an attraction towards certain kinds of protein surfaces, and so proteins which need to attract a zinc cofactor will have to present surface residues capable of doing this. It should be possible to predict, therefore, whether a protein's structure has a potential zinc binding site on it. Furthermore, because structure is determined by amino acid sequence, it should in principle be possible to predict zinc binding capabilities from protein sequence.

This PhD project is an attempt to develop novel methods for doing so.

\section{Zinc}

Any investigation into the phenomenon of zinc binding to proteins must begin with a look at zinc and its properties.

\subsection{Transition Metals}

Zinc is a transition metal, though an unusual one as we will see.
