Much of this project relies very heavily on reading in structure data from files deposited to the Protein Data Bank.

Traditionally these files have been stored and distributed in the form of .pdb files. These are text files that consist of a list of records, with each record being limited to 80 characters. Information is stored in these records at fixed offsets from the start of the line. This file format has a number of limitations - most notably the fact that they cannot store more than 100,000 atoms because only five characters are allocated to atom IDs, and so they cannot go past 99,999.

Consequently, the Protein Data Bank also provides files in the newer .cif file format - and indeed, structures with more than 100,000 atoms are \emph{only} available in this file format.

There are a number of parsers available that can handle these file formats, and which were considered for use in this project - both in Python and otherwise. However, for reasons that will be outlined shortly, it was decided to create a novel Python parser. This parser is called atomium.

\section{Rationale}

The tool used to read structure files is of such critical importance to this project, that it was important to ensure that the correct tool with the correct \emph{capabilities} was used. Specifically, the tool would need the following properties:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The ability to read .pdb files.
  \item The ability to read .cif files.
\end{itemize}

Probably the major Python PDB parser at time of writing is BioPython. This is a multi-purpose bioinformatics library, with many modules for dealing with general biological data formats. One of these modules allows for parsing of PDB structure files.

\section{Data Structures}

The object returned by the various parsing functions is a \texttt{File} object. This essentially represents the actual file object itself rather than its structural contents, and has attributes for PDB code, resolution, keywords, etc.

A \texttt{File} object has one or more \texttt{Model} objects.
